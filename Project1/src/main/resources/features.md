# Tuition Reimbursement Management System

## Employee Types

* The regular employee
	* No special characteristics or power.
	* Can submit forms for approval.
	* Has a base availability of $1000 of reimbursement funds.
	* Requests made that cost a certain amount (x) will subtract from this $1000
	  while they are pending, and after they are awarded. If a pending request
	  is denied, $x will be made available to the employee again, on top of the
	  funds that have not been allocated yet.
